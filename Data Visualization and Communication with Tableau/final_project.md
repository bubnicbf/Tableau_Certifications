# Recommendations for Dognition Business Process Changes

## Introduction:

Hello, my name is Ben Bubnick, and in this essay, I will present my recommendations and smart goal for implementing ideal business process changes for Dognition. The recommendations focus on increasing user engagement and completion rates, and the smart goal aims to improve the completion rate of the first 20 tests per subscriber by 10% over the next 3 months.

### Recommendation 1: Implement Achievements

One of the recommendations is to implement achievements, such as badges, to keep subscribers engaged. By creating a badge system, users can have a sense of accomplishment after completing a game. This approach encourages users to persist further and complete as many games as possible. Additionally, holding tournaments occasionally can foster competition among users, motivating them to showcase their talented dogs and strengthen their personality relationship with their owners.

### Recommendation 2: Send Out Targeted Reminders

Another recommendation is to send out targeted reminders to users, especially during times where engagement drops the most. For instance, the Eye Contact game, which is the fourth game, experiences a significant drop-off. By sending reminders during such critical points, users can be encouraged to continue their participation. It is also important to consider the timing of reminders, focusing on after-work periods and on Sundays at 7 pm, which are the times when users are most active.

### Recommendation 3: Use Social Media as an Alternative to Free Start Promotion

Considering that the Free Start promotion has not been effective, an alternative recommendation is to leverage social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. The Dognition team can actively post engaging content with tips, facts, and cute pictures of dogs. By utilizing social media channels, Dognition can reach a broader audience and generate interest in their services. This strategy can be particularly effective when implemented during weekends, from Friday through Monday.

To support these recommendations, data analysis was conducted to explore demographics, user participation, and drop-off rates.

## Geographical Spread of the Customer:

Analyzing the data, it is evident that the majority of Dognition customers are located in the United States, with California having the highest population of users. Based on this information, it is recommended to focus marketing and sales efforts in regions with the highest concentration of users, including California, North Carolina, New York, Texas, and Florida.

## Completion Rates: When Users are Most Active:

Data analysis reveals specific patterns regarding user activity. Dognition customers tend to play the most games at 7 pm, with Sundays being the day when they engage the most. Moreover, the month of October 2014 had the highest number of tests completed, which coincides with Dognition being featured on "60 Minutes." This indicates that publicity had a positive effect on increasing user participation levels.

## Drop-Off Rates: Insights into User Behavior:

Examining drop-off rates, it is observed that the Free Start promotion did not yield the expected results. Users who started with the Free Start promotion showed higher drop-off rates after the fourth game compared to those who did not start with the promotion. Therefore, the "Free Start" promotion can be canceled due to its lack of effectiveness.

Further analysis of the completion rates revealed that approximately 23% of Dognition users complete 20 tests. Additionally, the Eye Contact game showed the highest drop-off rate among the five subcategories, suggesting that dog owners may struggle to keep their pets engaged and motivated to proceed to another subcategory. It is possible that dogs have short attention spans, indicating the need for breaks between subcategories.

## Conclusion: Increasing User Participation and Improving User Experience
To increase user participation levels and enhance the user experience during tests, it is essential to implement the recommended strategies:

### Implement Achievements: 

Introduce a badge system to provide users with a sense of accomplishment and encourage them to complete more games. Additionally, holding tournaments periodically can further engage users.

### Send Out Targeted Reminders: 

Focus on sending reminders during critical points, such as after the Eye Contact game, and at times when users are most active, such as after-work periods and on Sundays at 7 pm.

### Use Social Media: 

Utilize platforms like Instagram and Facebook to share interesting tips, facts, and appealing dog-related content, especially during weekends from Friday through Monday.

By implementing these recommendations, Dognition can improve user engagement, increase completion rates, and enhance the overall user experience. These strategies align with the data analysis findings and aim to address the identified areas of improvement.
